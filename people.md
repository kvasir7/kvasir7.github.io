# Drew Davis, Ph.D. (Collaborator)

### Drew Davis is an Associate Research Scientist in the School of Earth, Environmental, and Marine Sciences at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. His research broadly centers on the ecology and conservation of amphibians and reptiles, primarily through understanding the distribution and diversity of species across the landscape and how stressors affect individuals and populations. To answer research questions, Drew uses emerging technologies (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles and eDNA metabarcoding) to supplement traditional survey methodologies, laboratory experiments, and specimen-based studies using natural history collections.

# Boston Urban Rat Study (BURS) Group (Collaborators)

### The Boston Urban Rat Study is a collaborative research group based in the Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. The group studies Boston’s urban rat population with a focus on the role rats play in propagating diseases that impact humans, and in turn, a broader view of the role rats have in the health and sustainability of the evolving urban ecosystem. This group includes a number of associated personnel that can be found on the their homepage:
