## Woodhams Lab (Collaborators)

The Woodhams lab integrates research and education through the study of immunological ecology, symbiotic microbiota, and conservation medicine. Their goal is to effectively manage amphibian chytridiomycosis, to understand mechanisms of resilience to disease at the scales of individual, population and landscape, and to develop an amphibian model system for mucosal immunity using vaccination and microbiome manipulation. Similarly, they aim to apply ecological insight toward reducing the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. They are also interested in novel biotherapies that restore and stabilize beneficial microbial communities, linking ecology to public health. This group includes a number of personnel that can be found on their homepage: https://woodhamslab.com/people/

## Boston Urban Rat Study Group (Collaborators)

The Boston Urban Rat Study (BURS) is a collaborative research group based in the Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. The group studies Boston’s urban rat population with a focus on the role rats play in propagating diseases that impact humans, and in turn, a broader view of the role rats have in the health and sustainability of the evolving urban ecosystem. This group includes a number of associated personnel that can be found on the their homepage: https://sites.tufts.edu/bostonurbanratstudy/our-team/

## Davis Lab (Collaborators)

The Davis Lab at Eastern New Mexico University broadly centers on the ecology and conservation of amphibians and reptiles, primarily through understanding the distribution and diversity of species across the landscape and how stressors affect individuals and populations. To answer research questions, the Davis Lab uses emerging technologies (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles and eDNA metabarcoding) to supplement traditional survey methodologies, laboratory experiments, and specimen-based studies using natural history collections.
