# Drew Davis, Ph.D. (Collaborator)

### Drew Davis is an Associate Research Scientist in the School of Earth, Environmental, and Marine Sciences at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. His research broadly centers on the ecology and conservation of amphibians and reptiles, primarily through understanding the distribution and diversity of species across the landscape and how stressors affect individuals and populations. To answer research questions, Drew uses emerging technologies (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles and eDNA metabarcoding) to supplement traditional survey methodologies, laboratory experiments, and specimen-based studies using natural history collections.
