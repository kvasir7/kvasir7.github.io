            <h2>Research Program</h2>
            <p>
              The Microbe-host Ecology and Macroevolution (MEME) group is broadly insterested in pattern, process, and form (PPF) at the interface of ecology and macroevolutionary biology. Specifically, our group seeks to delineate and explain contemporary ecological phenomena in the context of macroevolutionary contraints and adaptations across multiple levels of biological organization. Ecological PPF related to microbe-host(mutlicellular organism) interactions are of particular interest for their necessary reflection of innovations, constraints, and adaptations over geological time. This formalist-centric (yet functionalist inclusive) paradigm uses microbe-host systems that provide a useful framework for addressing questions at multiple levels of temporal and organizational scale. General areas and specific questions the MEME group takes interest in include:

            <h2>Amphibian Cladal Trends</h2>
            <p>
              This project aims to answer significant historical questions vis-à-vis host-associated microbes in fluid-preserved amphibian specimens. Specifically, it is hypothesized that microbial gut communities will vary in diversity and function both within and between amphibian assemblages over spatiotemporal gradients. Such changes may also precede disease related declines of the associated hosts, such as chytridiomycosis in amphibians. These hypotheses are being tested by utilizing recently developed techniques for isolation and purification of degraded DNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing for generating host-associated gut metagenome data. Sequence-based taxonomic and functional analysis is being used with a variety of bioinformatics and machine-learning software on high-performance computing resources. By utilizing museum specimens and their associated locality information, I also aim to explicate changes in host-associated microbiomes of amphibian assemblages in response to differential land-use and land-cover (LULC) in the Midwest and Northeast United States from the 1880s to present. Statistical mixed-effects models are currently being implemented for evaluating changes in host-associated microbial metagenomes and will include the integration of publicly available LULC datasets. The project will therefore further my own training in GIS for integration into microbial ecology research, and also promote the mentoring of students from underrepresented groups in using museum collections for answering questions pertaining to microbial ecology and evolution.

            <h2>Turtle Microbiomes</h2>
            <p>
              The turtle microbiome project aims to ask eco-evolutionary questions relating to the microbiome of turtles, to include ongoing sampling work with Graptemys sp. (False Map turtles) and Kinosternon sp. (Mud Turtles) throughout the United States. Turtles in particular have been an important historical focal point for questions relating to evolutionary novelties. 
	            Questions being asked in this system include: How do bacterial microbiomes change along environmental gradients? How do host-associated bacterial microbiomes vary among conspecifics at different sites and to what extent are turtle microbiomes transmitted longitudinally (which may help clarify questions related to host-microbe determinism and constraints)? And most importantly, how do turtle associated microbiomes mediate evolutionary-developmental trajectories (e.g. carapacial ridge gene expression patterns) and novelties (rib-scapula inversion) in turtles, specifically the emergence of the shell as a morphological novelty.

            <h2>Human-Rat Synanthropy</h2>
            <p>
              I am currently part of the collaborative Boston Urban Rat Study (BURS). This group aims to answer various questions realting to urban rats and human health in Boston, MA. The component of the study of which I am working is specifically interested in rat microbiome and virome associations with different health outcomes in humans and other animal species. Our understanding of interacting ‘omes’ among changing animal communities and their environments is limited and this study will help clarify these unknowns. We currently are characterizing the microbiome and the virome of urban rats to establish a baseline for the species and to understand how the microbiome and virome change temporally and geographically. Other questions of interest include: How different is the rat microbiome from the human microbiome? What viruses are rats carrying and are they zoonotic? How do the rat microbiome and virome change based on habitat type, season, and interaction with other animals, including humans?

            <h2>History and Philosophy of Biology (ISE)</h2>
            <p>
              Description: This course will provide an overview of the historical development of various strands of philosophical thought in the biological sciences, with an emphasis on ecology and evolution. This overview will range from ancient proto-naturalistic thinking to contemporary philosophy of biology, to include ongoing debates with broad societal implications. The course will draw on student discussion and critical thinking as a means for analysis of the emergence, intermixing, and fading of these philosophies. By the end of the course students will be able to understand and analyze the historical development of the dominant philosophical paradigms in the biological sciences. Students will also have practice in contextualizing and critiquing the historical and philosophical bases of related social issues such as neo-eugenics and the biodiversity crisis.
