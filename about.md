# Research Program

The Microbe-host Ecology and Macroevolution (MEME) group is broadly insterested in pattern, process, and form (PPF) at the interface of ecology and macroevolutionary biology. Specifically, our group seeks to delineate and explain contemporary ecological phenomena in the context of macroevolutionary contraints and adaptations across multiple levels of biological organization. Ecological PPF related to microbe-host(mutlicellular organism) interactions are of particular interest for their necessary reflection of innovations, constraints, and adaptations over geological time. This formalist-centric (yet functionalist inclusive) paradigm uses microbe-host systems that provide a useful framework for addressing questions at multiple levels of temporal and organizational scale. General areas and specific questions the MEME group takes interest in include:

## Evolutionary Innovations, Constraints, and Adaptations

How do (1) macroevolutionary innovations and (2) constraints on adaptation manifest in contemporary ecological interactions of microbes and multicellular organisms (PPF)?

## Levels of Action (canonically as the "levels of selection")
 
Do answers to the above questions vary by level of biological organization (e.g. gene, organism, group, species, clade)?

## Encompassing the Paleontological Record

While our group does not directly study the paleontological record (yet), we are necessarily interested in how answers to the above questions fit paleontological data, and vice versa (how paleontological work might influence our questions and interpretation of results).
