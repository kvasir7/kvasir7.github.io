# Research Program

### The Microbe-host Ecology and Macroevolution (MEME) group is broadly insterested in pattern, process, and form (PPF) at the interface of ecology and macroevolutionary biology. Specifically, this group seeks to delineate and explain contemporary ecological phenomena in the context of macroevolutionary contraints and channels across multiple levels of biological organization. Ecological PPF related to microbe-host(mutlicellular organism) interactions are of particular interest for their necessary reflection of channels, constraints, and innovations over geological time. This formalist-centric (yet functionalist inclusive) paradigm uses microbe-host systems that provide a useful framework for addressing questions at multiple levels of temporal and organizational scale. General areas and specific questions the MEME group takes interest in include:

## Evolutionary Constraint/Channeling, Saltations, and Innovation

#### -How are constraints/channnels manifested in the ecological interactions of microbes and multicellular organisms?
#### -What constraints/channels do microbial communities impose on the development and adaptive evolution of multicellular organisms? 
#### -How are constraints/channels altered?
#### -What role do microbial communities have in saltations of multicellular organisms?
#### -How do constraints/channels impart macroevolutionary innovations and novelty?

## Levels of Action (canonically as the  "levels of selection")
 
#### -Do answers to the above questions vary by level of biological organization (e.g. gene, organism, group, species, clade)?
#### -If so, how do they relate? Under what contexts do constraints/channels at different levels dominate?

## Encompassing the Paleobiological Record

#### While our group does not directly study the paleobiological record (yet), we are necessarily interested in how answers to the above questions fit paleobiological data, and vice versa (how paleobiological work might influence our questions and interpretation of results).
