### The Microbe-host Ecology and Macroevolution (MEME) group is broadly insterested in biological phenomena at the interface of ecological and macroevolutionary processes. Specifically, this group seeks to delineate and explain contemporary ecological processes as the outcomes of macroevolutionary contraints across multiple levels of selection. This formalist-first paradigm utilizes host-microbe systems to answer these questions as such systems provide a unique and useful framework for addressing questions at multiple levels of temporal and organizational scale.
