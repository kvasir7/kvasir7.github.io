### The Microbe-host Ecology and Macroevolution (MEME) group is broadly insterested in pattern, process, and form at the interface of ecology and macroevolutionary biology. Specifically, this group seeks to delineate and explain contemporary ecological processes as the outcomes of macroevolutionary contraints across multiple levels of selection. This formalist-centric paradigm uses host-microbe systems that provides a useful framework for addressing questions at multiple levels of temporal and organizational scale.
